# Multivariate Analysis
Finally, we have reached the point where we can begin to do some multivariate analysis. Though there are many multivariate models, we'll focus on the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, which is popular in communication research. We'll also go over how to do Granger causality tests and how to plot Impulse Response Functions (IRFs).

This folder contains three important files.
1. The **slidedeck** provides an overview of Vector Autoregression Models (including references). We recommend that you start with this.
2. The **varmodeling** markdown file is a tutorial of how to run your first VAR model, Granger causality tests, and IRFs. 
3. Data from this tutorial can be found in the **brexit_exercise_data.csv**. We also use this data for our [data visualization topic](https://github.com/jlukito/timeseries-bootcamp/tree/master/4_visualization).
